## The Two Systems of Thinking

To make sense of how we think, psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West introduced the idea of two mental systems: **System 1** and **System 2**.

These aren’t physical parts of the brain, but a helpful way to understand our mental processes.

So, here’s the takeaway:

- **System 1** is fast, automatic, and intuitive (like identifying emotions).
- **System 2** is slow, effortful, and analytical (like solving math problems).
