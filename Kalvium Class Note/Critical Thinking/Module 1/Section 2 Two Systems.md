## The Two Systems of Thinking

To make sense of how we think, psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West introduced the idea of two mental systems: **System 1** and **System 2**.

These aren’t physical parts of the brain, but a helpful way to understand our mental processes.

So, here’s the takeaway:

- **System 1** is fast, automatic, and intuitive (like identifying emotions).
- **System 2** is slow, effortful, and analytical (like solving math problems).

This shows how our mind operates:

- When a task is **familiar**, System 1 takes over effortlessly.
- But when we face **complex or unfamiliar problems**, System 2 kicks in to handle the load.

In fact, your brain **always starts with System 1**—only when it struggles does it call in System 2 for backup.
