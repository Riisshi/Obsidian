## IDEA MODEL

- Presents the **IDEA** model for structured problem-solving.
    
- Helps avoid random trial-and-error approaches.
    

---

### 🔸 Step 1: **Identify**

- Define the **actual problem**, not just the symptoms.
    
- Use tools like **cause-and-effect diagrams**.
    
- Ask: _“What’s really going wrong?”_
    

---

### 🔸 Step 2: **Develop**

- Brainstorm **multiple solutions** without judgment.
    
- Think creatively—**divergent thinking** is key.
    
- Group ideas by **feasibility** or **impact**.
    

---

### 🔸 Step 3: **Execute**

- Select the most promising solution.
    
- Implement it with **clear steps, milestones, and accountability**.
    
- Start small with a **pilot run**, if possible.
    

---

### 🔸 Step 4: **Assess**

- Evaluate whether the solution worked.
    
- Use **metrics and feedback** to measure effectiveness.
    
- If not successful, **loop back** and iterate.

### 📝 Conclusion & Tips

- Use IDEA for personal, team, or organizational problems.
    
- Strength: Simple and adaptable.
    
- Limitation: May require tweaks for complex or technical issues.
    

### Scientific Method

**1. Observation & Question**

- Scientists begin by noticing something interesting or unexpected in their environment.
    
- This observation leads to a question like, _“Why did my bread not toast?”_
    

**2. Hypothesis Formation & Prediction**

- They form a **hypothesis**, a testable explanation (e.g., toaster isn’t plugged in).
    
- Based on that, they predict what should happen if the hypothesis is correct.
    

**3. Testing the Hypothesis**

- Conduct an experiment or test the prediction (e.g., plug into a working socket).
    
- The test must be systematic and controlled—change only one variable at a time.
    

**4. Analyze & Interpret Results**

- Look at the outcomes: if the toaster works after being plugged in, the hypothesis is supported; if not, it’s rejected.
    
- Even supported hypotheses aren’t proof—they simply gain credibility through testing.
    

**5. Iteration**

- If results don’t fit expectations, refine the hypothesis or pose a new one.
    
- Rinse and repeat until findings become reliable.
    

**6. Broader Understanding & Communication**

- Beyond testing, the method requires **systematic observation**, asking **empirical questions**, and sharing findings publicly [solarwinds.com+15courses.lumenlearning.com+15learn.k20center.ou.edu+15](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/adolescent/chapter/the-scientific-method/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[braganholo.github.io](https://braganholo.github.io/material/escience/02-ScientificMethod.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[learn.k20center.ou.edu+1braganholo.github.io+1](https://learn.k20center.ou.edu/lesson/346?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- Publishing allows peer review and collaborative self-correction.
